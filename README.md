# Biblecast

BibleCast is a tiny desktop app that will let you cast bible quotes on a projector. It works by typing a bible quote (i.e. gen1) and a translation (use any of biblegateway.com available bible translations)

You can use the keyboard to control the app:

- left/down arrow keys: goes one verse back
- right/up arrow keys: goes one verse forth
- escape: moves the focus to the bible quote input
- F5: toggles fullscren mode
- backspace: goes to first verse

## Setup

Install deps with `yarn`, then:

```yarn start``` will start the app in dev mode.  
```yarn test``` will test the app. 
```yarn build``` will build the app and package it along the desktop app.
```yarn release``` will publish to app to github
